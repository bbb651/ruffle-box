# Ruffle Box

A small project that let's you add flash games to a library and load them with [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).

I plan to add PWA and storage support, I might remake this project with svelte now that I have a proof of concept.

## Development Environment

To serve the static files you'll need a web server that can serve them as a `wasm` MIME type, I found [sheret](https://github.com/ethanpil/sheret) is a good option.
